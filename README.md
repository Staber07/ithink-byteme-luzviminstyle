# About this project
Welcome to LuzViMin your premier online destination for renting and buying exquisite gowns and suits that celebrate the rich tapestry of Filipino fashion. Founded by three innovative students from Baliuag University, LuzViMin is a virtual one-stop shop dedicated to bringing the diverse and vibrant styles of the Philippines to a global audience. LuzViMin was born out of a shared passion for fashion and a deep love for Filipino culture. As students of Baliuag University, we recognized the potential to merge these two passions into a project that could make a meaningful impact. Inspired by the beauty and diversity of our country's fashion, we embarked on this journey to create a platform that honors and promotes Filipino design.
